| ------ | ----------- |
| 15     | Define a class named `PingPongColorChanger` |
| 15     | Constructor accepts an `image` |
| 35     | Method, `change_color` accepts a BGR color tuple and returns `output` |
| 5      | Create other re-usable methods as necessary |
| 10      | Test code in (a) Jupyter block if using Colab or (b) in `"__main__"` at the bottom of the script. Test code instantiates your class and utilizes the methods. Test code turns the ping pong balls 3 different colors and produces output images.  |
| 15     | Background is preserved |
| 5      | Code is well-commented |
| 5 ***b*** | ***Bonus***: Code works on all 4 test images in the `assets/` directory |
